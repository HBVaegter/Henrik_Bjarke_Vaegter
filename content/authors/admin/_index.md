Henrik Bjarke Vægter is an internationally leading researcher in the field of pain, exercise and pro- and anti- nociceptive mechanisms. His primary research expertise lies within pain, physical activity, and interdisciplinary rehabilitation with a particular focus on quantitative assessment of pro- and anti-nociceptive mechanisms in individuals with chronic pain to understand how these manifestations influence outcomes after rehabilitation.

Henrik Bjarke Vægter is Head of the interdisciplinary Pain Research Group at University Hospital Odense and he has extensive experience in working in interdisciplinary teams and networks nationally and internationally within this area. He is leading several large scale externally funded projects and randomized controlled trials in clinical practice.

Henrik has published extensively within the field of pain and exercise, and is author of 70 publications in international peer-reviewed journals (2/3 as first or senior author) with several papers published in the top five journals in the pain and exercise field (e.g. PAIN, Journal of Pain, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise). His H-index is 23 (Google Scholar).

Henrik has led the development and implementation of 2 electronic clinical registries (PainData and FunkData) including patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures across more than 20 private and public interdisciplinary rehabilitation centers in Denmark, and is now leading the steering group for development of quality indicators in interdisciplinary pain management in Denmark comprising multiple professional disciplines (center leaders, physicians, nurses, psychologist, physiotherapists, secretaries and patient-representatives). Furthermore, he has a strong collaboration with Danish Regions where he is part of the implementation group for the project Value- Based Health Care in high-impact chronic pain.

Henrik is associate editor for Scand J Pain since 2020 and perform numerous ad-hoc reviews for scientific journals, including frequent reviews for top journals within the pain field.
